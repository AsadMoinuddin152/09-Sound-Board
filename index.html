                    Everything that you thought had meaning: every hope, dream,
                    or moment of happiness. None of it matters as you lie
                    bleeding out on the battlefield. None of it changes what a
                    speeding rock does to a body, we all die. But does that mean
                    our lives are meaningless? Does that mean that there was no
                    point in our being born? Would you say that of our slain
                    comrades? What about their lives? Were they meaningless?...
                    <br />They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us
                    all! The courageous fallen! The anguished fallen!
                    <br />Their lives have meaning because we the living refuse
                    to forget them! <br />And as we ride to certain death, we
                    trust our successors to do the same for us! <br />Because my
                    soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty
                    of this world! My soldiers push forward! <br />My soldiers
                    scream out! <br />My soldiers RAAAAAGE! <br />
